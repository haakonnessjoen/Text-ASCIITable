	  arrayrefs. Wish ref: http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=14703

0.14  Sun Mar 21 23:56:12 2004
	- Cleaned/rewrote the Text::ASCIITable::Wrap code. Same result, better code.

	  if allowANSI or allowHTML was set.
	- Added support for a callback subroutine instead of the internal count function.
	- Added some caching in getColWidth.
	- alignCol and setOptions now accepts a hash to set values.

0.13  Sun Feb 22 20:30:00 2004
	- Fixed first bug. Tables got wider if it was a lot of html/ansi codes
	  even if ansisupport was turned on.
	- Fiex bug in draw() on designoutput. delim character was set to
	  linecharacter.
	- Made a wordwrap-module from scratch, and turned out to be more
	  accurate than the previous. Text::ASCIITable::Wrap.
	- Fixed a bug which prevented you to have ANSI/HTML-codes in the
	  beginning and end of a rowline and in headingText.
	- Added support for cutting the table for page-viewing. With a max
	  width. Thanks to Khemir Nadim ibn Hamouda <nadim at khemir.net> for

	- Added easier access to printing. You can now use print $t; which
	  does the same as print $t->draw() do.
	- Changed the default look/"theme". It was just too ugly :P
	- Added multiline support for columnnames.
	- Cleaned up some code.

0.10  Sat Mar 22 15:44:12 2003
	- Fixed so headingText makes the table wider, if its wider than the
	  table should originally be. Thanks to my friend Rune F. Akselsen
	  for the nice and easy "formula".
	- Added allowANSI support. Works just like allowHTML just with ANSI
	  codes. Exampletext with ansicodes: "Hi \33[1mThis is bold\33[m..."

0.09  Sat Feb 15 12:24:42 2003

	  between every row.
	- Added FEATURES section to the documentation.

	  true value, the width of the column will be set to this width.

0.07  Tue Jan 14 12:45:03 2003
	- Stopped to use Text::Aligner, because I needed one
	  with the possibillity to change strictness of the function
	  and counting procedures. So I made my own simple align function.
	- Added allowHTML option. To do this i needed to stop using
	  Text::Aligner.

0.06  Sat Jan 11 17:41:32 2003
	- Went over to use Text::Aligner instead of own functions.
