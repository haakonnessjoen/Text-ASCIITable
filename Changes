0.11	Sat	Aug	16 16:33:42 2003
	- Added easier access to printing. You can now use print $t; which
		does the same as print $t->draw() do.

	- Cleaned up some code.

0.10  Sat Mar 22 15:44:12 2003
	- Fixed so headingText makes the table wider, if its wider than the
	  table should originally be. Thanks to my friend Rune F. Akselsen
	  for the nice and easy "formula".
	- Added allowANSI support. Works just like allowHTML just with ANSI
	  codes. Exampletext with ansicodes: "Hi \33[1mThis is bold\33[m..."

0.09  Sat Feb 15 12:24:42 2003
	- Added headingText option, wich makes a Title on the top of
	  the table, spanning all the columts to one large title.
	- Added descriptions to all the possible options in the
	  documentation.

0.08  Sat Jan 18 14:44:21 2003
	- Added drawRowLine option, to make it draw a line
	  between every row.
	- Added FEATURES section to the documentation.
	- Added strict option to setColWidth. If $strict is set to a
	  true value, the width of the column will be set to this width.

0.07  Tue Jan 14 12:45:03 2003
	- Stopped to use Text::Aligner, because I needed one
	  with the possibillity to change strictness of the function
	  and counting procedures. So I made my own simple align function.
	- Added allowHTML option. To do this i needed to stop using
	  Text::Aligner.

0.06  Sat Jan 11 17:41:32 2003
	- Went over to use Text::Aligner instead of own functions.
	- Added alignCol. (Which uses Text::Aligner)
	- Made alignColRight an alias to alignCol($col,'right');
	- Added options to hide lines/headrow from output.
	- Added 'reporterrors' for removal of error reporting to STDERR.
        - Added multiline support for AddRow.
	- Added wordwrap support, using Text::Wrap.
