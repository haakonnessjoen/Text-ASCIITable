NAME
    Text::ASCIITable - Create a nice formatted table using ASCII characters.
    Nice, if you want to output dynamic text to your console or other
    fixed-size displays.

SYNOPSIS
      use Text::ASCIITable;
  
      $t = new Text::ASCIITable;
      $t->setCols(['Nickname','Name']);
      $t->addRow('Lunatic-|','Håkon Nessjøen');
      $t->addRow('tesepe','William Viker');
      $t->addRow('espen','Espen Ursin-Holm');
      $t->addRow('mamikk','Martin Mikkelsen');
      $t->addRow('p33r','Espen A. Jütte');
      print $t->draw();

FUNCTIONS
  setCols(@cols)
    Define the columns for the table(compare with <TH> in HTML). For example
    "setCols(['Id','Nick','Name'])". Note that you cannot add Cols after you
    have added a row.

  addCol($col)
    Add a column to the columnlist. This still can't be done after you have
    added a row.

  addRow(@collist)
    Adds one row to the table. This must be an array of strings. If you
    defined 3 columns. This array must have 3 items in it. And so on. Should
    be self explanatory.

  alignColRight($col)
    Given a columnname, it aligns all data to the right in the table. This
    looks nice on numerical displays in a column. The column names in the
    table will not be unaffected by the alignment.

  getTableWidth()
    If you need to know how wide your table will be before you draw it. Use
    this function.

  draw([@topdesign,@rowdelims,@middle,@bottom])
    All the arrays containing the layout is optional. If you want to make
    your own "design" to the table, you can do that by giving this method
    these arrays containing information about which characters to use where.

    Examples:

    The easiest way:

     $t->draw();

    Explanatory example:

     $t->draw( ['L','R','-','D'],   # L------D------R
               ['H','M'],           # | info H info |  (the M is delemiter on the rows, like H is on the colums-row)
               ['L','R','-','D'],   # L------D------R
               ['L','R ','_','D']   # L______D______R
              ));

    Nice example:

     $t->draw( ['.','.','-','-'],   # .-------------.
               ['|','|'],           # | info | info |
               ['|','|','-','-'],   # |-------------|
               [' \\','/ ','_','|'] #  \_____|_____/
              ));

    Nice example2:

     $t->draw( ['.=','=.','-','-'],   # .=-----------=.
               ['|','|'],             # | info | info |
               ['|=','=|','-','+'],   # |=-----+-----=|
               ["'=","='",'-','-']    # '=-----------='
              ));
